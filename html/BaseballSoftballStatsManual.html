<center><h3><u>ABOUT BASEBALL/SOFTBALL STATISCIAL SYSTEM</u></h3></center>
<p style="color:#f8f8f8;">The Baseball/Softball Statistical System is designed to track team, batting 
and pitching stats for a league, or muliple teams or players.

<p>Version 1.0 is a Linux-only system, and requires both mySQL and Zenity. 
MySQL is the driver for keeping and creating data Views that the system uses 
to display, update and report on statistics, from both a league/team and players view.

<p>The programs check to make sure that all the requisite systems (mySQL and Zenity) 
are both installed, and for mySQL, that its server is running, otherwise the system 
will not run. Future releases will incoporate something like openGL for the GUI, making 
it both cross-platform and give the user the choice of GUI, as Zenity will then become 
an option rather than a requirement, as well as looking into different SQL systems, like 
sqlite and MariaDB.

<h4><u>HOW TO USE THE MAIN MENU</u></h4>
<p>This is the main menu and process controller. A menu is presented of options. You can either 
select an option and click "OK", or double click on it to execute that option. To exit 
the application, click on the "x" in the uipper right-hand, or click either the <Cancel> or <QUIT> 
buttons. The menu options are:

<ul>
<li><b><u>Boxscores - Add/Update</u></b><br>
This option will produce both the hitting and pitching statistics for a 
specific team. A screen will display asking you for a team name, game ID
and number of games played. The last two fields are optional, and are
only used when you update a player. Selecting this option will bring you
into a module that allows you to display, add and update player hitting
statistics. More information will be provided on game ID and games played
in the HELP when in the Batting and Pitching modules. When finished, the 
system will redisplay the Main Menu.<p></li>
	
<li><b><u>Batting - Add/Update</u></b><br>
This option will bring up a display of all the hitting statistics in the
SQL Table for the team selected. As in Boxscores, a screen will display 
asking you for a team name, game ID and number of games played. When 
finished, the system will redisplay the Main Menu.<p></li>

<li><b><u>Pitching - Add/Update</u></b><br>
This option will bring up a display of all the pitching statistics in the
SQL Table for the team selected. As in Boxscores, a screen will display 
asking you for a team name, game ID and number of games played. When 
finished, the system will redisplay the Main Menu.<p></li>

<li><b><u>League/Team Stats</u></b><br>
This will display all the statistics based on Teams. You will get three
displays from this option. The first is League Standings, ordered by
Win Percent, which is used by MLB and other leagues to officially rank
teams. The next two screens will display the hitting and pitching 
statistics for each team. In these two, the teams are listed in no
particular order. From here you can print out any of the 3 displays.<p></li>
	  
<li><b><u>Create New SQL Region</u></b><br>
If you want to create a new mySQL database, or new tables in an existing
database, this is the option you will use. Remember that once you change
the database, tables, mySQL user id and/or password, this will replace
any existing values in the system's config file. From this point forward,
the system will use these values to manage and report on statistics. More
information on this is available in the Config File processing screen.<p></li>

<li><b><u>Config File</u></b><br>
If you need to make individual changes to anything in the system, this is
the option to use. If you want to change the database, tables, user id 
and/or password, here is where you can make those changes. Unlike the
"Create New SQL Region" menu option, this will not affect the SQL tables.
This just changes the way the system will process after the changes. In
otherwords, the changes you make must already exist in mySQL, otherwise
the system will abnormally terminate. More information on this is 
available in the Config File processing screen.<p></li>
