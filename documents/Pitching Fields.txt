Advanced (Calculated Stats)

ERA (Earned Run Average): The average number of earned runs a pitcher allows per 9 innings. ((ER*9)/IP)
K/9 (Strikeouts per 9 innings): Average number of strikeouts per 9 innings.
BB/9 (Walks per 9 innings): Average number of walks per 9 innings.
K/BB (Strikeout to Walk Ratio): Strikeouts divided by walks.
K% (Strikeout Percentage): Frequency with which the pitcher has struck out a batter, calculated as strikeouts divided by total batters faced.
AVG (Batting Average Against): Rate of hits allowed per at bat, calculated as H/AB.
WHIP (Walks Plus Hits per Inning Pitched): The average number of base runners allowed via hit or walk per inning.
BABIP (Batting Average on Balls in Play): The rate at which the pitcher allows a hit when the ball is put in play, calculated as (H-HR)/(AB-K-HR+SF).
FIP (Fielding Independent Pitching): An estimate of a pitcher’s ERA based on strikeouts, walks/HBP, and home runs allowed, assuming league average results on balls in play.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HR/9 (Home Runs per 9 innings): Average number of home runs allowed per 9 innings.
BB% (Walk Percentage): Frequency with which the pitcher has issued a walk, calculated as walks divided by total batters faced.
K%-BB% (Strikeout Percentage minus Walk Percentage): The percentage differential between K% and BB%, often a better indicator of performance than K/BB, which can be skewed by very low walk rates.
LOB% (Left On-Base Percentage): Percentage of pitcher’s own base runners that they strand over the course of a season. Not equal to the LOB column in the box score.
ERA- (Earned Run Average minus): ERA adjusted for park effects and league average (set to 100 for each year).
FIP- (Fielding Independent Pitching minus): FIP adjusted for park effects and league average (set to 100 for each year).
xFIP (Expected Fielding Independent Pitching minus): xFIP adjusted for park effects and league average (set to 100 for each year).
E-F (ERA-FIP Differential): The difference between the pitcher’s ERA and FIP.
xFIP (Expected Fielding Independent Pitching): An estimate of a pitcher’s ERA based on strikeouts, walks/HBP, and fly balls allowed, assuming league average results on balls in play and home run to fly ball ratio.
SIERA (Skill Interactive ERA): An ERA estimator that attempts to more accurately capture a pitcher’s performance based on strikeouts, walks/HBP, home runs, and batted ball data.
