&nbsp
<p style="color:#f8f8f8;"><h4><u>BATTING STATS UPDATE PROCESSING</u></h4>
<p>This processes the updates to the hitting statistics for a selected team as well as allowing to add
new players to the batting SQL Table. </p>
	
<p>This program is can be either executed from the main menu, or can run as a stand-a-lone program. Some
of the functions will slightly change, but all the main processing will be the same, regardless of how
the module is started. </p>
&nbsp

<p><b><u>Updating Hitting Stats</u></b>
<p></p>

<center><img src="images/baseballStats - Hitting Update1.png" style="width:100%"></center>
<p>To refresh, you are presented with a boxscore from the team you want to update. From the screen above, 
you select the players you want to add data to. When you click the [Update] button, you will be presented
with the update screen. </p>

<center><img src="images/baseballStats - Hitting Update2.png" style="width:100%"></center>
<p>Here is where you will add game stats to both existing and new players. For
each player you checked off in the screen prior, a record has already been added to the Stats Update screen.
You will also noticed that GAMEID has been pre-filled with "ALE-09" as was provided in the Team/Game input
box, as well as a "1" you also provided in the GP column.</p>
	
<p>You will also notice that the very first column there is a lowercase "u". This is important, as you will later
see that two things must be done in order to apply any update. That "u" must be present, and all records to update
must be selected. More on that.	</p>

<center><img src="images/baseballStats - Hitting Update3.png" style="width:100%"></center>
<p>Next, enter the values you need to update. As you can see above, I have started to enter data for LeMahieu. To enter
data, click on the column and you will be able to input to it. You only have to enter data that you have. All fields
are initialized as ZEROES. Do this for all data you have.</p>
	
<p>Also, say you made a mistake and put in the wrong GameID. On this screen you can also change it. In the image above,
GameID was changed to ALE-10. Same can be done with with GP. If you decide that you do not wish to update a player, 
say you selected him/her by error, you can remove the "u" next to the name.</p>

<center><img src="images/baseballStats - Hitting Update4.png" style="width:100%"></center>
<p>In the above, you can see that I have added a player, and decided to remove the "u" from the players I
do not wish to update. In order for Zenity to pass the changes to the application, you must select them by
using the standard keyboard-mouse selection technique [SHIFT] + Left-click on the mouse to select a range, or [CTRL]
and left mouse-click to select/unselect individual records.</p>

<p>To update a record, remember, you must have both the "u" in the "S" column (S=Select, u for Update), and the record must be 
selected (highlighted in Orange as the above shows). To finalize all updates, click the [COMMIT] button to process all updates
selected.</p>

<p>In the example above, there are several types of updates. First, Doe, J has a GAMEID of "ALE-10", and a games played (GP) of 3.
In this case, even though I have assigned a gameid, I am updating 3 games worth of stats for J Doe. For each game played, GP is
equal to 1. Since I am updating J Doe with 3 games worth of data, I must make this field 3. Another way to update this player is
to enter each game separate. The application allows you to enter multiple, individual game records for the same player.</p>
	
<p>Also, the only updates that will be done above is for LeMahieu, Encarnacion, Hicks and Doe. All have both a "u" and are highlighted.
Both must be done in order for the update to take. Even though Torres has a "u" in the S column, he isn't selected. Zenity will
not pass this record to the application. Judge and Urshela are highlighted, and will be passed to the application by Zenity.
However, the application will check to see if they have the "u" set. If not, the application will ignore those records.</p>
