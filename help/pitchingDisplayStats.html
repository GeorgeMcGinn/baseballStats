<center><h3><u>ABOUT BASEBALL/SOFTBALL STATISTICS SYSTEM - v1.0</u></h3></center>
&nbsp
&nbsp
<p style="color:#f8f8f8;"><h4><u>PITCHING STATS PROCESSING</u></h4>
<p>This processes the pitching statistics for a selected team as well as allowing updates to and
adding new players to the pitching SQL Table. </p>
	
<p>This program is can be either executed from the main menu, or can run as a stand-a-lone program. Some
of the functions will slightly change, but all the main processing will be the same, regardless of how
the module is started. </p>

<p>After you input data into the Team/Game Input Box. you will get a current display of pitching stats for each player, 
like below:</p>

&nbsp
&nbsp
<center><img src="images/baseballStats - Pitching Display1.png" style="width:100%"></center>
<p><b><u>Displaying the Pitching Boxscores</u></b>
<p>Once you enter a team name and click the [OK] button, you will see a screen similar to the one below.
The application tracks a variety of baseball/softball stats, which are first displayed for you. From here
you may send the results to the printer, or update them.</p>

&nbsp
&nbsp
<p><b><u>The Buttons - And What They Do</u></b>
<p>There are five buttons, along with the "x" in the upper right-hand corner of the screen. Here are the
actions they perform:</p>


<table style="width:90% border:0px">
  <tr>
    <td width=15% valign="top" style="text-align: right"><b>[Cancel]</b></td>
    <td>Resets boxscore display and re-displays it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width=15% valign="top" style="text-align: right"><b>[Update]</b></td>
    <td>Takes all records checked (if any) and displays the update screen.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width=15% valign="top" style="text-align: right"><b>[Report]</b></td>
    <td>Formats the boxscores displayed and prints it on the default printer.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width=15% valign="top" style="text-align: right"><b>[HELP]</b></td>
    <td>Displays this screen.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width=15% valign="top" style="text-align: right"><b>[QUIT]</b></td>
    <td>Cancels out of pitching stats and either returns to main menu or ends if stand-a-lone.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width=15% valign="top" style="text-align: right"><b>[x]</b></td>
    <td>This works the same as the [QUIT] button.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><b><u>Updating Pitching Stats</u></b>
<p>You have a boxscore from a game you need to update. From the screen above, you can add new data to both
existing players and new players that have yet to play a game. </p>

<p>For existing players, place a check mark (as shown above) next to each player you wish to add new game
stats for. For players not in the current display, you will be able to add them once you click the [Update]
button.</p>
	
<center><img src="images/baseballStats - Pitching Display3.png" style="width:100%"></center>
<p>The next screen (shown above) is the one you use to add game stats to both existing and new players. For
each player you checked off in the screen prior, a record has already been added to the Stats Update screen.
You will also noticed that GAMEID has been pre-filled with "ALE-10" as was provided in the Team/Game input
box, as well as a "1" you also provided in the GP column.</p>
	
<p>You will also notice that the very first column there is a lowercase "u". This is important, as you will later
see that two things must be done in order to apply any update. That "u" must be present, and all records to update
must be selected. More on that.	</p>

<center><img src="images/baseballStats - Pitching Update1.png" style="width:100%"></center>
<p>Next, enter the values you need to update. As you can see above, I have entered data for Workman. To enter
data, click on the column and you will be able to input to it. You only have to enter data that you have. All fields
are initialized as ZEROES. Do this for all data you have.</p>
	
<p>Also, say you made a mistake and put in the wrong GameID. On this screen you can also change it. In the image above,
GameID was entered as ALE-10. You can go into this field and edit it to the value you want it to be.
Same can be done with with GP. If you decide that you do not wish to update a player, 
say you selected him/her by error, you can remove the "u" next to the name.</p>

<center><img src="images/baseballStats - Pitching Update2.png" style="width:100%"></center>
<p>In the above, you can see that I have added a player, J. Bagofdounuts. In order for Zenity to pass the changes to the 
application, you must select them by using the standard keyboard-mouse selection technique [SHIFT] + Left-click on 
the mouse to select a range, or [CTRL] and left mouse-click to select/unselect individual records.</p>

<p>To update a record, remember, you must have both the "u" in the "S" column (S=Select, u for Update), and the record must be 
selected (highlighted in Orange as the above shows). To finalize all updates, click the [COMMIT] button to process all updates
selected.</p>

<p>As in the Hitting Update, I can add multiple games pitched data to a player, or enter each game individually on the same
update panel. You can even update data for the same GAMEID. The system will merge these records when it is time to display
the pitching boxscores.</p>

<p>Also, the only updates that will be done above is for Workman and Bagofdounuts. All have both a "u" and are highlighted.
Both must be done in order for the update to take. Zenity will not pass this record to the application.
However, if a record is selected without a "u" in the S Column, the application will check to see if the "u" is set. 
If not, the application will ignore the record.</p>
