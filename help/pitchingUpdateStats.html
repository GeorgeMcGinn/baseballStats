<center><h3><u>ABOUT BASEBALL/SOFTBALL STATISTICS SYSTEM - v1.0</u></h3></center>
&nbsp
&nbsp
<p><h4><u>PITCHING STATS PROCESSING</u></h4>
<p>This processes the pitching statistics for a selected team as well as allowing updates to and
adding new players to the pitching SQL Table. </p>
	
<p>This program is can be either executed from the main menu, or can run as a stand-a-lone program. Some
of the functions will slightly change, but all the main processing will be the same, regardless of how
the module is started. </p>

<p>After you input data into the Team/Game Input Box. you will get a current display of pitching stats for each player, 
like below:</p>

&nbsp
&nbsp

<center><img src="images/baseballStats - Pitching Display2.png" style="width:100%"></center>
<p><b><u>Updating Pitching Stats</u></b>
<p>You have a boxscore from a game you need to update. From the screen above, you can add new data to both
existing players and new players that have yet to play a game. </p>

<p>For existing players, place a check mark (as shown above) next to each player you wish to add new game
stats for. For players not in the current display, you will be able to add them once you click the [Update]
button.</p>
	
<center><img src="images/baseballStats - Pitching Display3.png" style="width:100%"></center>
<p>The next screen (shown above) is the one you use to add game stats to both existing and new players. For
each player you checked off in the screen prior, a record has already been added to the Stats Update screen.
You will also noticed that GAMEID has been pre-filled with "ALE-10" as was provided in the Team/Game input
box, as well as a "1" you also provided in the GP column.</p>
	
<p>You will also notice that the very first column there is a lowercase "u". This is important, as you will later
see that two things must be done in order to apply any update. That "u" must be present, and all records to update
must be selected. More on that.	</p>

<center><img src="images/baseballStats - Pitching Update1.png" style="width:100%"></center>
<p>Next, enter the values you need to update. As you can see above, I have entered data for Workman. To enter
data, click on the column and you will be able to input to it. You only have to enter data that you have. All fields
are initialized as ZEROES. Do this for all data you have.</p>
	
<p>Also, say you made a mistake and put in the wrong GameID. On this screen you can also change it. In the image above,
GameID was entered as ALE-10. You can go into this field and edit it to the value you want it to be.
Same can be done with with GP. If you decide that you do not wish to update a player, 
say you selected him/her by error, you can remove the "u" next to the name.</p>

<center><img src="images/baseballStats - Pitching Update2.png" style="width:90%"></center>
<p>In the above, you can see that I have added a new pitcher, Cashner, A. Workman was a relief pitcher, and I needed to add a
new starting pitcher that hadn't been added yet. So I updated Workman with his relief efforts for game ALE-10, and
added the new pitcher with his starting effort.</p>

<p>In order to update these values to the pitching table, Zenity needs to pass the changes to the application. 
First, you must select them by using the standard keyboard-mouse selection technique [SHIFT] + Left-click on 
the mouse to select a range, or [CTRL] and left mouse-click to select/un-select individual records.</p>

<p><i>NOTE: Zenity is the GUI that this application uses to process all menus, displays, and updates. Zenity is the new
incarnation of gdialog. Both are GNOME GUI systems.</i></p>

<p>To update a record, remember, you must have both the "u" in the "S" column (S=Select, u for Update), and the record must be 
selected (highlighted in Orange as the above shows). To finalize all updates, click the [COMMIT] button to process all updates
selected.</p>

<p>You can add multiple games pitched data for any number of players, or enter each game individually on the same update screen. 
You can even update data for the same GAMEID. The system will merge these records when it is time to display the pitching boxscores.</p>

<p>Also, the only updates that will be done above is for Workman and Cashner. All have both a "u" and are highlighted.
Both must be done in order for the update to take. Zenity will not pass this record to the application. However, if a record 
is selected without a "u" in the S Column, the application will check to see if the "u" is set. If not, the application will 
ignore the record.</p>

<p>The reason that you need a "u" in the S-Column is that in a future release, this screen will also allow you to edit and delete
records. For now, update is the only option available.</p>

  </tr>    
</table>
<p></p>
<p><i>NOTE: For FIP, I use 3.214 as the FIP Constant (cFIP), which represents MLB's 2019 FIP constant. Since the team data being used
   by this example is from 2019, this is the appropriate value. If you want to calculate the current or your league's FIP Constant:
   cFIP = league ERA-((13*league HR)+(3 *(league BB+league HBP))-(2*league K))/league IP.</i></p>
