<center><h3><u>ABOUT BASEBALL/SOFTBALL STATISTICS SYSTEM - v1.0</u></h3></center>
&nbsp
<p style="color:#f8f8f8;">The Baseball/Softball Statistics System is designed to track team, 
	batting and pitching stats for a league, or multiple teams or players.

<p>Version 1.0 is a Linux-only system, and requires both mySQL and Zenity. 
	MySQL is the driver for keeping and creating data Views that the system uses 
	to display, update and report on statistics, from both a league/team and players view.</p>

<p>The programs check to make sure that all the requisite systems (mySQL and Zenity) 
	are both installed, and for mySQL, that its server is running, otherwise the system 
	will not run. Future releases will incorporate something like openGL for the GUI, making 
	it both cross-platform and give the user the choice of GUI, as Zenity will then become 
	an option rather than a requirement, as well as looking into different SQL systems, like 
	sqlite and MariaDB.</p> 

<h4><u>HOW TO USE THE MAIN MENU</u></h4>
<p>This is the main menu and process controller. A menu is presented of options. You can either 
	select an option and click "OK", or double click on it to execute that option. To exit 
	the application, click on the [x] in the upper right-hand, or click either the [Cancel] or [QUIT] 
	buttons. The menu options are:

<center><img src="images/baseballStats - Main Menu.png" style="width:75%"></center>
<ul>
<li><b><u>Boxscores - Add/Update</u></b><br>
	This option will produce both the hitting and pitching statistics for a 
	specific team. A screen will display asking you for a team name, game ID
	and number of games played. The last two fields are optional, and are
	only used when you update a player. Selecting this option will bring you
	into a module that allows you to display, add and update player hitting
	statistics. More information will be provided on game ID and games played
	in the HELP when in the Batting and Pitching modules. When finished, the 
	system will re-display the Main Menu.</li>
&nbsp	
<li><b><u>Batting - Add/Update</u></b><br>
	This option will bring up a display of all the hitting statistics in the
	SQL Table for the team selected. As in Boxscores, a screen will display 
	asking you for a team name, game ID and number of games played. When 
	finished, the system will re-display the Main Menu.</li>
&nbsp
<li><b><u>Pitching - Add/Update</u></b><br>
	This option will bring up a display of all the pitching statistics in the
	SQL Table for the team selected. As in Boxscores, a screen will display 
	asking you for a team name, game ID and number of games played. When 
	finished, the system will re-display the Main Menu.</li>
&nbsp
<li><b><u>League/Team Stats</u></b><br>
	This will display all the statistics based on Teams. You will get three
	displays from this option. The first is League Standings, ordered by
	Win Percent, which is used by MLB and other leagues to officially rank
	teams. The next two screens will display the hitting and pitching 
	statistics for each team. In these two, the teams are listed in no
	particular order. From here you can print out any of the 3 displays.</li>
&nbsp	
<li><b><u>Create New SQL Region</u></b><br>
	If you want to create a new mySQL database, or new tables in an existing
	database, this is the option you will use. Remember that once you change
	the database, tables, mySQL user id and/or password, this will replace
	any existing values in the system's config file. From this point forward,
	the system will use these values to manage and report on statistics. More
	information on this is available in the Config File processing screen.</li>
&nbsp
<li><b><u>Config File</u></b><br>
	If you need to make individual changes to anything in the system, this is
	the option to use. If you want to change the database, tables, user id 
	and/or password, here is where you can make those changes. Unlike the
	"Create New SQL Region" menu option, this will not affect the SQL tables.
	This just changes the way the system will process after the changes. In
	other words, the changes you make must already exist in mySQL, otherwise
	the system will abnormally terminate. More information on this is 
	available in the Config File processing screen.</li>
</ul>
