<center><h3><u>ABOUT BASEBALL/SOFTBALL STATISTICS SYSTEM - v1.0</u></h3></center>
&nbsp
<p>The Baseball/Softball Statistics System is designed to track team, 
	batting and pitching statistics for a league, or multiple teams or players.

<p>Version 1.0 is a Linux-only system, and requires both mySQL and Zenity. 
	MySQL is the driver for keeping and creating data Views that the system uses 
	to display, update and report on statistics, from both a league/team and player's view.</p>

<p>The programs check to make sure that all the requisite systems (mySQL and Zenity) 
	are both installed, and for mySQL, that its server is running, otherwise the system 
	will not run.</p> 
&nbsp;
<h4><u>HOW TO USE THE MAIN MENU</u></h4>
<p>This is the main menu and process controller. A menu is presented of options. You can either 
	select an option and click "OK", or double click on it to execute that option. To exit 
	the application, click on the [x] in the upper right-hand, or click either the [Cancel] or [QUIT] 
	buttons. The menu options are:

<center><img src="images/baseballStats - Main Menu.png" style="width:60%"></center>
<ul>
<li><b><u>Boxscores - Add/Update</u></b><br>
	This option will produce both the hitting and pitching statistics for a 
	specific team. The first screen displayed will ask you for a team name, gameID
	and number of games played. The last two fields are optional, and are
	only used when you update or add players. After entering a required team name, 
	the first screen displayed will be the hitting statistics for every player on your
	selected team. Here you can then update the team's hitting, or cancel/quit out of it.
	When you quit or cancel from this screen, it will next display the pitching screen 
	for the team name you selected in the beginning. As with the hitting screen, you
	can add or update player pitching stats. Each screen also allows you to print the
	report to your local printer. More information will be provided on gameID and games 
	played in the HELP when in the Batting and Pitching modules. When finished, the 
	system will re-display the Main Menu.</li>
&nbsp	
<li><b><u>Batting - Add/Update</u></b><br>
	This option will bring up a display of all the hitting statistics in the
	SQL Table for the team selected. As in Boxscores, a screen will display 
	asking you for a team name, gameID and number of games played. When 
	finished, the system will re-display the Main Menu.</li>
&nbsp
<li><b><u>Pitching - Add/Update</u></b><br>
	This option will bring up a display of all the pitching statistics in the
	SQL Table for the team selected. As in Boxscores, a screen will display 
	asking you for a team name, gameID and number of games played. When 
	finished, the system will re-display the Main Menu.</li>
&nbsp
<li><b><u>League/Team Stats</u></b><br>
	This will display all the statistics based on Teams. You will get three
	displays from this option. The first is League Standings, ordered by
	Win Percent, which is used by MLB and other leagues to officially rank
	teams. The hitting screen will display the hitting statistics for each team.
	The teams are listed by OPS, from highest to lowest. The pitching screen 
	displays the pitching statistics, and are ordered by 
	Wins/Losses. From here you can print out any of the 3 displays.</li>
&nbsp	
<li><b><u>Create New SQL Region</u></b><br>
	If you want to create a new mySQL database, or new tables in an existing
	database, this is the option you will use. Remember that once you change
	the database, tables, mySQL user id and/or password, this will replace
	any existing values in the system's config file. From this point forward,
	the system will use these values to manage and report on statistics. More
	information on this is available in the Config File processing screen.
	<br><b>*** NOTE: This will replace your current settings ***</b></li>
&nbsp
<li><b><u>Config File</u></b><br>
	If you need to make individual changes to anything in the system, this is
	the option to use. If you want to change the database, tables, user id 
	and/or password, here is where you can make those changes. Unlike the
	"Create New SQL Region" menu option, this will not affect the SQL tables.
	This just changes the way the system will process after the changes. In
	other words, the changes you make must already exist in mySQL, otherwise
	the system will abnormally terminate. More information on this is 
	available in the config.ini file processing screen. Here you can switch, say
	between a softball league that plays 7 inning games to a baseball league
	that plays 6, 7 or 9 innings. Check the manual on how to set up multiple
	leagues with different innings per game for more details.</li>
