&nbsp
<p style="color:#f8f8f8;"><h4><u>BATTING STATS PROCESSING - HITTING DISPLAY/UPDATE</u></h4>
<p>This processes the hitting statistics for a selected team as well as allowing updates to and
adding new players to the batting SQL Table. </p>
	
<p>This program can be either executed from the main menu, or can run as a stand-a-lone program. Some
of the functions will slightly change, but all the main processing will be the same, regardless of how
the module is started. </p>

<p>At the bottom of this HELP display is a legend showing what each column in the boxscore means, and in 
some cases, how it's calculated.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<center><img src="images/baseballStats - Hitting Stats1.png" style="width:90%"></center>
<p><b><u>Displaying the Hitting Boxscores</u></b>
<p>Once you enter a team name and click the [OK] button, you will see a screen similar to the one above.
The application tracks a variety of baseball/softball stats, which are first displayed for you. From here
you may send the results to the printer, update them, or go back and enter another team.</p>

<center><img src="images/baseballStats - Hitting Stats2.png" style="width:90%"></center>
<p>If you are entering data for a new team, you would enter the team name in the Team Input screen. Let's say
we want to add the Astros to our database. After entering Astros in the team name of the Team Input screen, you
will get a display like the one above. Since there is no data for the Astros, a blank screen appears. If you
click the [Update] button, you will be taken to the update screen where you can add the stats for the new
team, and they will be added to the database tables. Once that happens, whenever you input Astros, it will display
all the data you've entered.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><u>The Buttons - And What They Do</u></b>
<p>There are five buttons, along with the "x" in the upper right-hand corner of the screen. Here are the
actions they perform:</p>


<table style="width:90% border:0px">
  <tr>
    <td width=15% valign="top" style="text-align: right"><b>[Cancel]</b></td>
    <td>Cancels out of the current display and re-displays the first screen.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width=15% valign="top" style="text-align: right"><b>[OK]</b></td>
    <td>Clears the current screen and displays the next. If on the Pitching Stats screen, the application will re-display the League Standings screen.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width=15% valign="top" style="text-align: right"><b>[Report]</b></td>
    <td>Formats the current display and prints it on the default printer.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width=15% valign="top" style="text-align: right"><b>[HELP]</b></td>
    <td>Displays this screen.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width=15% valign="top" style="text-align: right"><b>[QUIT]</b></td>
    <td>Cancels out of current screen and either returns to main menu or ends if running stand-a-lone.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width=15% valign="top" style="text-align: right"><b>[x]</b></td>
    <td>This works the same as the [QUIT] button.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

&nbsp		
<center><img src="images/baseballStats - Hitting Update1.png" style="width:90%"></center>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><u>Updating Hitting Stats</u></b>
<p>You have a boxscore from a game you need to update. From the screen above, you can add new data to both
existing players and new players that have no game records in the batting table. </p>

<p>For existing players, place a check mark (as shown above) next to each player you wish to add new game
stats for. For players not in the current display, you will be able to add them once you click the [Update]
button.</p>
	
<center><img src="images/baseballStats - Hitting Update2.png" style="width:90%"></center>
<p>The next screen (shown above) is displayed when you select the [Update] button, and is the one you will use to add 
game stats for both existing and new players. For each player you checked off in the screen prior, a record has 
already been placed on the Stats Update screen. You will also noticed that GAMEID has been filled with "ALE-10" 
as was provided in the Team/Game input box, as well as a "1" also provided in the GP column. If you did not provide
a GAMEID or a Games Played value in the Team Input Box, then GAMEID will be blank, and GP will have a "1" in it.</p>
	
<p>You will also notice that the very first column there is a lowercase "u". This is important, as you will later
see that two things must be done in order to apply any update. That "u" must be present, and all records to update
must be selected.</p>

<center><img src="images/baseballStats - Hitting Update3.png" style="width:90%"></center>
<p>Next, enter the values you need to update. As you can see above, I have started to enter data for LeMahieu. To enter
data, click on the column and you will be able to input into it. You only have to enter data that you have. All fields
are initialized as ZEROES. Do this for all data you have.</p>
	
<p>Also, say you made a mistake and put in the wrong GameID. On this screen you can also change it. Same can be done with 
with GP. If you decide that you do not wish to update a player, say you selected him/her by error, you can remove the "u" 
next to the name.</p>

<p>You can also add multiple game records for the same player. In the example above (and highlighted on orange) I added
another set of game stats for DJ LeMahieu for gameID "ALE-11". Not only can you add new players that did not appear in the
boxscore display screen, but you add multiple records for the same player. The application, when applying the updates,
treats each update as a separate transaction.</p>

<center><img src="images/baseballStats - Hitting Update4.png" style="width:90%"></center>
<p>In the above, you can see that I have added a player (it can be a new player or existing one), and decided to remove the "u" 
from the players I do not wish to update. In order for Zenity to pass the changes to the application, you must select them by
using the standard keyboard-mouse selection technique [SHIFT] + Left-click on the mouse to select a range, or [CTRL]
and left mouse-click to select/un-select individual records.</p>

<p><i>NOTE: Zenity is the GUI that this application uses to process all menus, displays, and updates. Zenity is the new
incarnation of gdialog. Both are GNOME GUI systems.</i></p>

<p>To update a record, remember, you must have both the "u" in the "S" column (S=Select, u for Update), and the record must be 
selected (highlighted in Orange as the above shows). To finalize all updates, click the [Commit] button to process all updates
selected. To cancel all the updates before they are applied, either click on the [Cancel] or [QUIT] buttons (click on the [X] does
the same thing).</p>

<p>In the example above, there are several types of updates. First, LeMahieu has a second record with GAMEID of "ALE-11".
If I had to, I could have combined both games into one record, and changed GP from a 1 to a 2. You have the flexibility to update
multiple players with multiple game data. The only limit currently is that you can only do 25 updates at once. A future release will
remove this restriction. It was originally put into place because MLB has a 25-man roster restriction, which means each game
can have no more than 25 players playing in one game. However, since the requirements changed to potentially allow multiple records
per player, you may have more than 25 updates if you are behind in your updates. For now, you can do multiple updates.</p>
	
<p>In the above update screen, the only updates that will be done above is for LeMahieu, Judge, Urshela, and Torres. All have both a "u" 
and are highlighted. Both must be done in order for the update to take. Even though Hicks has a "u" in the S column, he isn't selected. 
Zenity will not pass this record to the application. Encarnacion is highlighted, and will be passed to the application by Zenity.
However, the application will check to see if "u" set. If not, the application will ignore that record and any record without a "u".</p>

<p>The reason that you need a "u" in the S-Column is that in a future release, this screen will also allow you to edit and delete
records. For now, update is the only option available.</p>
