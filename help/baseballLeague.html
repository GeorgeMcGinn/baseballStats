<center><h3><u>ABOUT BASEBALL/SOFTBALL STATISTICS SYSTEM - v1.0</u></h3></center>
&nbsp;
<p><h4><u>LEAGUE DISPLAYS</u></h4>
<p>The League Display screens display league stats for each team. This accumulates existing
team, hitting and pitching data and produces a League Standings, Hitting Stats and Pitching
Stats per team.</p>

<p>No updates are done. This is to show how all the teams are doing compared to each other.
To advance from one display to another, click on the [NEXT] button. The [BACK] button appears
on the last screen displayed, and will take you back to the League Standings display.
To exit out of League Displays, click on [QUIT].</p>

<p>The following shows each screen, and what it shows:</p>

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<p><b><u>League Standings Display</u></b>
&nbsp;
<center><img src="images/baseballStats - League1.png" style="width:60%"></center>
	
<p>The screen above shows what the League Standings display looks like. The teams are ordered
based on MLB's criteria of win percentage (WPCT) rather than Games Behind. </p>

<p>Games Behind is not always an accurate measure of the distance between two teams. It is the average 
of the number of games a team trails the percentage leader in the win column and the number of games 
that team trails the leader in the loss column. This is why win percentage (WPCT) is used by MLB and
by this application. A future release may incorporate Games Behind, but it will be for display purposes
only.</p>

<p>For a more detailed explanation about Games Behind, you can read Milton Eisner's 
<a href="http://research.sabr.org/journals/a-truer-measure-of-games-behind">"A Truer Measure of ‘Games Behind’"</a> 
article.</p>
	
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<p><b><u>League Batting Display</u></b>
&nbsp;
<center><img src="images/baseballStats - League2.png" style="width:90%"></center>
	
<p>The screen above shows the totals for each team's offensive and defensive stats. The teams are listed
based on their OPS. As with any display screen, if you want to rank the teams by batting average or another 
stat, just click on that column.</p>

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<p><b><u>League Pitching Display</u></b>
&nbsp;
<center><img src="images/baseballStats - League3.png" style="width:90%"></center>
	
<p>The screen above shows the totals for each team's pitching stats. The teams are listed
based on their Wins and Loss. As with any display screen, if you want to rank the teams, say by
ERA or another stat, just click on that column.</p>
